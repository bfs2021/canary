// US instruments, the reason the window skips US-closed sessions too).

// default send, the preview, the prepared path and the submit hold it with
// one blocker, and the standing-mandate controller refuses it before
// journaling and sends at its first ready read; the owner's hand is told the

// open, hours before the US open, and nothing enforced the due time (the
// quality loop, 2026-10-18 23:00 CEST; built at the integrator's ask).
