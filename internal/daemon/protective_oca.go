// One-cancels-all beside Canary's own stop (owner decision 2026-10-12 19:55
// CEST, which admits a sale of at most the confirmed long position whatever
// else is working, and the residual-risk fix recorded in
// internal-docs/design/protective-stop-guard.md, "One-cancels-all").
//
// Two orders Canary itself placed or admitted must never sell the same
// shares twice. A sell stop or trail Canary places is born in its own IBKR
// one-cancels-all group (Order.proto ocaGroup=27, ocaType=30), type 2:
// when a member fills, in whole or in part, the broker reduces the others
// and routes one member at a time. A later Canary sale of the same contract
// that, with Canary's own working stop, would sell more than is held joins
// that group by name, so the first fill reduces the other at the broker
// without waiting for the guard. A stop the broker reports without a group
// (placed before groups existed) cannot be joined, and the IB API offers no
// way to put a working order into a group other than a full modify whose
// acceptance of a changed group is undocumented; Canary does not try. That
// stop is shrunk to what the sale leaves, or cancelled when nothing is
// left, through the guard's gated modify and cancel path, the broker's
// answer is awaited, and only then is the sale sent, plain. When the change
// fails or stays unconfirmed, the sale is refused with the reason and the
// stop is left as it is; an unlinked sale is never sent beside its own
// stop. A hand order in TWS is the owner's: never linked, never changed.
// The protective stop guard stays as the second line of defence and counts
// an unlinked Canary sale against its stops (planProtectiveStopGuard).
